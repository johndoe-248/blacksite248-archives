## SUBJECT DESIGNATION
- **Designation:** *Entity — (Confirmed) “The Leviathane”*  
- **Incident Tag:** US-Δ/PELAG-01  
- **First Contact:** Deep-Sea Relay Station 09, Sector Pelagos  
- **Threat Level:** Eldritch / Abyssal-Class — Cognitive-Tidal Phenomenon (Code: BLUE ABYSS)  
- **Affected Region:** Urbanshade Littoral Zone, 24 km off main port

## SUMMARY
A deep-oceanic entity, codenamed *The Leviathane*, has been identified as the primary source of large-scale hydrospheric distortions and sub-threshold psychic resonance across the Urbanshade coast.  
The creature exhibits characteristics similar to both vertebrate and cephalopod morphology — elongated, eel-like main structure exceeding 400 meters in verified length, with multiple fractal appendages capable of refracting light and sound beneath the surface.  

When it surfaces within 6 nautical miles of human infrastructure, localized **“mind tides”** occur — mass auditory hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and induced apathy across entire districts.  
Charon Research’s **External Repellent System (ERP)** is the only proven deterrent mechanism, preventing Leviathane from crossing the continental drop zone perimeter.

## PHENOMENOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION
- **Physical appearance:** A colossal serpentine mass of cartilage and unknown composite tissue. Appears metallic under low light but scatters sonar like liquid static. Appendages resemble tendrils, each tapering into threadlike feelers that emit bioluminescent pulses.  
- **Hydrodynamic distortion:** Ocean currents reverse flow within a 2 km radius when Leviathane is active. Pressure sensors register waves that arrive *before* physical displacement occurs.  
- **Auditory manifestation:** Low-frequency subharmonics (0.3–0.9 Hz) often mistaken for tectonic rumbling. Prolonged exposure induces cognitive drowning: loss of sense of self, recurring dreams of descent.  
- **Psychic projection:** Witnesses report flashes of vast, unlit corridors beneath the sea and an instinctive command — *"Sink, and remember."*  
- **Behavioral pattern:** Emergence correlates with deep-sea infrastructure failure, high-stress human populations, or prolonged neglect of maritime zones. Appears drawn to entropy and noise from abandoned machinery.

## KNOWN EFFECTS
1. **Hydrospheric Warping:** Water density fluctuates; depth and buoyancy readings become unreliable.  
2. **Neural Overload:** Human cognition destabilizes under the infrasonic pressure field. Symptoms include vertigo, sleep intrusion, and sudden mutism.  
3. **Infrastructure Corrosion:** Metallic objects near presence oxidize instantly; electronics fail due to electromagnetic resonance.  
4. **Perception Drift:** Distant shapes appear closer or inverted; observers may perceive reflections of themselves moving independently.  
5. **Bioelectric Feedback:** Marine life dies or exhibits synchronized motion patterns along the continental shelf.

## EXTERNAL REPELLENT SYSTEM (ERP) — OVERVIEW  
**Purpose:** Establish and maintain an acoustic/phase barrier around Urbanshade's coastal perimeter to repel Leviathane’s projections and prevent surfacing events.  

**System Components:**  
- **Subsurface Emitters (SE):** Anchored devices projecting inverse-phase sonar fields at 0.43 Hz to destabilize entity coherence.  
- **Thermal Vents (TV):** Controlled heat plumes creating vertical turbulence to simulate tectonic instability — Leviathane avoids seismic zones.  
- **Aural Dampers (AD):** Shore-based speakers releasing encoded pink noise patterns, disrupting cognitive contagion waves.  
- **Beacon Arrays (BA):** Optical lures redirect Leviathane’s attention away from inhabited sectors by generating false resonance echoes.  
- **Control Lattice (CL):** Central CRC AI managing real-time adjustments via hydrophonic telemetry; any desync over 3.2% risks resonance breach.  

**Operational Principle:**  
ERP does not contain Leviathane — it confuses its spatial sense. The creature perceives the coastline as a nonphysical zone — an “infinite depth.”

## DEPLOYMENT & MAINTENANCE PROTOCOL
1. **Emitter Calibration (daily, before high tide):**  
   - Validate frequency drift <0.002 Hz.  
   - Replace filters damaged by biofouling.  
2. **Thermal Sync (every 6 hours):**  
   - Maintain 9°C ±1°C variance in thermal plumes.  
3. **Aural Dampers Test (weekly):**  
   - Verify urban PA systems match CRC acoustic checksum.  
4. **Control Lattice Audit (continuous):**  
   - Monitor real-time node correlation; deploy emergency override if Leviathane pattern detected on sonar cluster.  

---

## EMERGENCY PROTOCOL (IF SURFACING EVENT OCCURS)
- Initiate **ERP Pulse Cascade** (Code ABYSS-LINE): three rapid sonar inversions.  
- Blackout coastal district within 60 seconds to reduce light draw.  
- Evacuate surface vessels and aerial craft within 10 nautical miles.  
- Deploy **Containment Buoys** (CB) — autonomous signal inhibitors forming temporary void lattice.  
- Post-incident: conduct neurocognitive screening on all exposed personnel (see Document CRC-MINDWASH-Δ2).

## FIELD REPORT EXCERPTS
> “The horizon folded upward like a ribbon. The ocean bent the sky, and for a moment, we saw the city reflected in the deep — upside down and still breathing.”  
> — Research Diver 09, Log 14-A  

> “Its eyes aren’t eyes. They’re windows looking back at the surface from somewhere deeper than water.”  
> — Sonar Technician, Station Pelagos  

> “ERP node 7 failed for 43 seconds. The silence afterward was worse than the hum.”  
> — Operator-Δ13  

---

## ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
- **Do not** deploy lethal payloads against Leviathane. Aggressive frequencies may provoke a surfacing cascade.  
- **Do not** store resonance recordings on unsecured media; playback may trigger minor summoning effects.  
- **Do** maintain psychological rotation among marine operators; recurrent dreams of drowning are predictive of breach.  

---

## RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONS
- Study Leviathane’s bioacoustic structure — it may encode non-human communication.  
- Investigate the link between urban entropy and abyssal surfacing probability.  
- Examine whether deep-sea ruins beneath Urbanshade act as amplification conduits.  
- Expand ERP capacity to include adaptive thermal modulation.

## FINAL NOTE
Leviathane is not a monster — it is a mirror. It rises when the surface forgets what lies beneath it.  
Our machines hum to keep it dreaming. Our cities stay lit to convince the dark it has no place here.
