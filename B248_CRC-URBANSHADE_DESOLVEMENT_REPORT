**CLASSIFICATION:** OLYMPUS-TIER — INTERNAL MEMORANDUM  
**SOURCE:** Charon Research Corp — Oversight & Ethics Division  
**STATUS:** ACTIVE — STRUCTURAL DESOLVEMENT IN PROGRESS  

---

## SUBJECT  
**Desolvement of the Urbanshade Division**  
**Former Director:** Mr. *Lucien Shade*  
**New Oversight:** Charon Research Corp (CRC) — Central Command  

---

## SUMMARY  
Effective immediately, the **Urbanshade Division**, formerly directed by *Lucien Shade*, is to undergo full **Desolvement** and reabsorption into CRC governance.  

The desolvement process is ongoing — Urbanshade infrastructure has not been fully dissolved, and residual systems remain operational under quarantine.  
All active assets, including digital archives, containment nodes, and field units, are confirmed **corrupted and/or under CRC control** pending full decontamination.  

Shade’s operational record shows extreme deviation from CRC ethical mandates, resulting in civilian risk, data corruption, and multi-sector instability within the Urbanshade perimeter.  

---

## BACKGROUND  
*Lucien Shade*, once a CRC research lead specializing in adaptive containment systems, founded the Urbanshade Division as an independent research extension.  
His ideology, *“Containment through Coexistence,”* initially earned CRC provisional approval due to promising resonance stability models.  

However, post-audit investigation revealed his methods deteriorated into **human experimentation**, **neural resonance grafting**, and **uncontrolled anomaly exposure trials**.  
CRC oversight confirmed Shade targeted **inmates with incomplete convictions** and **civilians with morally justified offenses** — individuals who would not meet CRC’s ethical testing criteria.  

---

## CRC ETHICAL DOCTRINE  
CRC’s directive framework remains unchanged and strictly enforced:  

1. **Containment with Humanity** — Testing requires verified legal clearance or consent.  
2. **Moral Absolutism Clause** — No experimentation until all case data is verified and conclusive.  
3. **Rehabilitation Priority** — CRC prefers reform to exploitation.  
4. **Zero-Casualty Policy** — Collateral harm is unacceptable under any operational context.  

Shade’s work systematically violated each clause.  
His indifference to due process and containment discipline rendered Urbanshade a liability to CRC’s long-standing reputation of integrity and calculated control.  

---

## INVESTIGATION FINDINGS  
CRC forensic teams identified the following within Urbanshade’s remaining data infrastructure:  

- **Corrupted Subject Records** — Dozens of falsified inmate files and missing consent forms.  
- **Illicit Containment Networks** — “Shade-tuned” grids emitting unstable resonance pulses across urban zones.  
- **Ethical Breach Logs** — Direct manipulation of staff through coercive resonance conditioning.  
- **Unstable Neural Constructs** — Possible attempts to synchronize the director’s consciousness with deep-anomaly signals.  

Witness accounts describe Shade’s demeanor in his final phase as “unanchored,” claiming he could *“hear the currents beneath thought.”*  

---

## DIRECTIVE — DESOLVEMENT PROCEDURE  
CRC Directive **OLYMPUS-Δ7** authorizes complete desolvement of Urbanshade’s infrastructure and identity.  

**Operational Steps:**  
1. Dissolve all Urbanshade contracts, licenses, and branding.  
2. Quarantine remaining laboratories and seal data cores for CRC use.  
3. Identify, detain, and debrief surviving Urbanshade personnel.  
4. Purge all traces of “Hadal Urbanshade” from CRC systems.  
5. Secure anomalies previously linked to Shade’s Resonance Program.  
6. Reclaim technological assets while preventing ideological contamination.  

CRC command emphasizes: *no element of Shade’s methods or legacy is to remain integrated into official CRC architecture.*  

---

## INCIDENT — “THE DROWNED GATE”  
Residual sensor data from the Urbanshade canal district suggests a resonance event linking Shade’s containment grids to an unidentified subaquatic anomaly.  
Following activation, environmental readings spiked — electromagnetic interference, biological degradation, and auditory hallucinations consistent with **Class-Hadal exposure**.  

CRC field units observed a rising distortion pattern resembling “an ocean without water.”  

Shade’s last recorded statement, recovered from corrupted vocal logs, reads:  

> “The tide listens. It only needs to be spoken to long enough.”  

---

## CURRENT STATUS  
- **Mr. Lucien Shade:** Missing / Presumed Assimilated.  
- **Urbanshade Division:** Incomplete dissolution; undergoing controlled desolvement.  
- **Remaining Assets:** Corrupted / Under CRC quarantine and command authority.  
- **ERP (External Repellent Program):** Redeployed under CRC modification protocols.  

---

## STATEMENT FROM CRC DIRECTOR Δ  
> “Shade’s flaw was compassion without structure.  
>  He mistook chaos for empathy.  
>  We will not repeat his experiment — or his faith.”  

---

## CONCLUSION  
Urbanshade’s desolvement is both logistical and ideological.  
No trace of the *Hadal Urbanshade* doctrine will persist under CRC operation.  
CRC reaffirms its principles of **ethical research**, **containment through order**, and **preservation of human life** as the foundation for future development.  

The Desolvement Directive will conclude only once Urbanshade’s name no longer echoes in CRC systems.
