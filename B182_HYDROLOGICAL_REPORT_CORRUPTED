## SUMMARY (SHARD)

Survey vessel **CRV Hekate** — deep-ridge sweep.  
Acoustic anomalies recorded; low-frequency patterning correlates with archival *liminal* signatures.  
Telemetry shows **recurrent regularity**, however several frames are corrupted / clipped.  
Visual confirmation of vertical object = **UNVERIFIED** (frame loss T+00:32 → T+00:34).

## FIELD RECORD 07–A (SHARDED MATRIX)

*(matrix retains original axis labels; some cells unreadable or altered during recovery)*

## LOG EXCERPTS (TRUNCATED / GLITCHED)

> [T+00:17] Sonar interference rising — frequency locked between channels **F** & **G**.  
> [T+00:18] Attempted recalibration — frame #0x1F4 **⧫⧈⟆** dropped.  
> [T+00:21] Technician notes repeating sequence: **O / P / V** observed across returns.  
> [T+00:25] Node 6A power fluctuation; grid sectors desyn— ███████████.  
> [T+00:26] Short impulse: **three bursts**, equal spacing — correlation window corrupted.  
> [T+00:27] Surface comms blacked out for 4.7s — last packet: `⨳⧗⟆⧫...` (incomplete)

## ANALYST FRAGMENTS

- Recovered metadata suggests intentional structure; not a random calibration artifact.  
- Matrix alignment fails standard hydrography templates — possibly encoded transport.  
- Several blocks reference a projection device (ob⟁lisk?) — fragmentary: `...projec⧈⧫...`  
- Operator-token handshake lines truncated or redacted in several shards (`[REDACTED-BLOCK]`).

## RECOVERY ATTEMPT LOG

`RECOVER 0x3A4B | START`  
> read block 001 → ok  
> read block 002 → ok  
> read block 003 → checksum mismatch → attempt parity repair → partial success  
> read block 004 → unreadable (binary noise) → flagged for deep-recovery  
> attempt deep-scan → return: `0100101 1010 ɸ ⧫⧫ ▒ ▓` → UNRESOLVED

`RECOVER 0x3A4B | END`  

`[ADVISORY]` — Deep-recovery attempts reported residual resonance in processing terminal; operators should log any sensory anomalies post-scan.

## USAGE / CAUTION

- The matrix may be used for reference in recon tools — **avoid using cell (X,X)** until verified.  
- If attempting deobfuscation, preserve original file; work on copies only.  
- Any attempt to replicate observed projection sequences without Summit-level authorization is forbidden.
