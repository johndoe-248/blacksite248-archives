SUBJECT: Post-Incident Analysis — Blacksite 182  

Document Code: B182-AFTER/ΔENTROPY  

Compiled by: Directorate of Internal Oversight (DIO)  
Date Filed: [REDACTED]  
Distribution: Restricted — Command Level Access Only  

SECTION 1: EVENT SUMMARY  

On [REDACTED], Blacksite 182 suffered a catastrophic systems collapse followed by the detonation of its internal thermonuclear failsafe. The facility, its staff, and all contained materials were lost.  

No distress call or evacuation confirmation was received. Data from nearby acoustic monitors registered a brief spike in low-frequency resonance prior to complete signal loss.  
The event’s signature does not fully match known detonation patterns, suggesting the failsafe may have been triggered under anomalous conditions.  

A follow-up drone expedition confirmed total destruction of the structure.  
Only trace metallic debris, scattered biological material, and warped hull plating were found suspended within the trench.  
Pressure readings indicate partial implosion prior to detonation.    

SECTION 2: STRUCTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT  

Status: Total loss  
Casualties: 95% confirmed 0.57% unconfirmed  
Data recovery: 0.02% (corrupted fragments)  

The area surrounding the former facility exhibits significant electromagnetic distortion and fluctuating thermal signatures.  
Sonar mapping fails beyond a radius of twelve kilometers. Several unmanned vehicles deployed for investigation experienced spontaneous system failures or disappeared entirely.  

Spectral scans reveal unusual radiation levels inconsistent with known isotopic decay. Attempts to isolate the cause have been inconclusive. 
The ocean floor at the blast site shows signs of liquefaction and vitrification, suggesting an energy release beyond standard nuclear yield.  

SECTION 3: POST-INCIDENT PHENOMENA  

Following the destruction of Blacksite 182, remote listening arrays began recording low-frequency signals originating near the detonation zone.  
These transmissions resemble rhythmic pulses or speech-like modulation, though content analysis yields no linguistic coherence.  

Several recovered recordings share a recurring interval pattern matching the facility’s internal power cycle frequency prior to its destruction.  
Analysts speculate this may indicate persistent electromagnetic echoes or residual energy loops.  

Thermal anomalies in the abyssal region continue to defy expected dissipation rates.  
Some suggest these readings may represent ongoing subatomic or metaphysical reactions initiated by the event.  

SECTION 4: DATA MANAGEMENT AND SECURITY PROTOCOLS  

All documentation pertaining to Blacksite 182 has been transferred to deep storage under Project Codename: ENTROPY ARCHIVE.  
Access is limited to Level-6 Administrative Staff.  
All personnel formerly attached to Blacksite 182 or related research divisions have been accounted for or debriefed.  
Several survivors from adjacent operations have reported recurring nightmares, sensory distortions, and auditory hallucinations.  

Psychological evaluations are ongoing. Cases of severe cognitive dissonance have been noted but remain officially unlinked to the incident.  

Public explanation of seismic activity near the region has been attributed to natural tectonic movement. No further public statements are authorized.  

SECTION 5: CONCLUSION  

Blacksite 182 is considered permanently lost. All research, experimental data, and contained materials are presumed unrecoverable.  
Current directives forbid reconstruction or re-establishment of facilities within a 100-kilometer radius of the incident site.  

Anomalous readings will continue to be monitored remotely.  
No further expeditions are authorized pending review by the Central Oversight Council.
